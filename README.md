Assignment 2 using Stacks and Queues for 3310 - Data and File Structures

1) Design and implement a Java class for stacks using linked lists (instead of the ones from the Java library), this class should have at least two function push() and pop()

2) Design and implement a Java class for queues using linked lists (don't use built-in queue related Java classes), this class should have at least two functions add() and delete() -- I called these functions enqueue() and dequeue()

3) Design and implement a strategy of using two stacks to implement the functionality of a queue

4) Use two queues to implement a stack

5) Implement a function minValue() for stack, which returns the minimum value witha time complexity of O(1). (HINT: can two stacks solve this problem?) (NOTE: this is an example of a tradeoff between space and time!)

6) Your implementations should work easily on int, float, double, and String type values - use Java Generics
